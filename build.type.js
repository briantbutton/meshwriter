    //By default all the configuration for optimization happens from the command
    //line or by properties in the config file, and configuration that was
    //passed to requirejs as part of the app's runtime "main" JS file is *not*
    //considered. However, if you prefer the "main" JS file configuration
    //to be read for the build so that you do not have to duplicate the values
    //in a separate configuration, set this property to the location of that
    //main JS file. The first requirejs({}), require({}), requirejs.config({}),
    //or require.config({}) call found in that file will be used.
    //As of 2.1.10, mainConfigFile can be an array of values, with the last
    //value's config take precedence over previous values in the array.

    //Set paths for modules. If relative paths, set relative to baseUrl above.
    //If a special value of "empty:" is used for the path value, then that
    //acts like mapping the path to an empty file. It allows the optimizer to
    //resolve the dependency to path, but then does not include it in the output.
    //Useful to map module names that are to resources on a CDN or other
    //http: URL when running in the browser and during an optimization that
    //file should be skipped because it has no dependencies.
    //e.g. if you wish to include `jquery` and `angularjs` from public CDNs,
    //paths: { "jquery": "empty:", "angular": "empty:" }
//  paths: {
//      "foo.bar": "../scripts/foo/bar",
//      "baz": "../another/path/baz"
